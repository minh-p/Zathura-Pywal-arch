# Zathura-Pywal

## Disclaimer:
This is my fork of Zathura-Pywal: https://github.com/GideonWolfe/Zathura-Pywal
dmenu wasn't working nicely so I changed the created zathura override to zathu in /usr/local/bin
The original zathura suggestion would still exist if you want to use that instead.

Zathura-Pywal is a set of helper scripts that dynamically theme zathura based on colors set by [pywal](https://github.com/dylanaraps/pywal).


## Installation

To install, simply move into the clone directory and run `./install.sh`

You can toggle normal colors by pressing `Ctrl+r`
